### What is a \(digital\) conference room?

You can imagine a digital room to be almost like an analogue one: something is happening in it and it can be equipped with different things \(room type\). In the context of DINA, it's digital events that may vary depending on the type of room. Each room has its own \(web\) page within your conference. We explain how to create rooms here:

### What is your definition of events?

For us, events are always about what is happening in a room. In a workshop room this might be a video conference, in a café room a digital café table and in a stage room this might be a YouTube stream. The lobby room, on the other hand, simply lists the events from all the other rooms and turns them into an agenda. You can find out how to create events under the following link:

### How do I present my event to the outside world?

Every digital conference on DINA has a so-called microsite. It is your space to be really creative and provide all relevant information about your event. Furthermore, interested parties can also register for the event via the microsite.

### Do participants of a digital conference need to have an account with DINA?

Currently, participants of a digital conference on the DINA platform still need a user account. However, we are working on providing access to digital events without an account. An external user with a login and password will then be able to gain temporary access to a conference. As soon as this function is available, it will be displayed to the conference admin.
