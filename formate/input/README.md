# Knowledge Sharing



![](../../.gitbook/assets/gitbook_forum_750x32.jpg)

Conferences are a great opportunity **to bring together loads of knowledge** that is usually dispersed in different minds - and this opportunity needs to be seized! For fresh ideas, you can invite more external input providers who can expand or refresh your own knowledge. But it' s precisely the existing **brainpower of the group** which is a huge resource that can be unleashed with the right formats. When sharing knowledge, it is important to always keep the context of the participants in mind and to invite them to get involved again and again. Activating learning is more fun and leads to better results!
