The only way to make human gatherings truly successful is to get to know each other. A trusting relationship is the basis of good cooperation, group spirit can move a great deal, even beyond an event. Before you get into the content at a meeting, you should give yourself some time for an informal yet structured getting to know each other. In the course of the meeting, ice breaking formats should remind you that the whole thing is also about having fun harnessing the energy of interpersonal interaction.
